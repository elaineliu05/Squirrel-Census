MITRE Data Science and Analytics track - created data visualizations and grouped data aggregations from New York Squirrel Census data. Specifically, Pandas and Seaborn packages were used to create bar charts, scatterplots, and tables to display temporal analysis and correlation between variables (ie fur color, vocal communications, etc).
